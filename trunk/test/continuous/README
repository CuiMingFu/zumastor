These are the components of the continuous build server that are run on the
host machine and set up each run of the build and test as new releases of
the archive are made.  As they are running on the host machine and have
access to host resources, networks, etc, they should not automatically
update from the repository.  Copy them all to a dedicated user's home
directory, and check out a read-only copy of zumastor/ there.  They will
update the zumastor/ repository, build packages from it, and run the test
suites.
