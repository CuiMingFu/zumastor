cbtb (continuous build and test build) tests are grouped by the number of
virtual instances required to run the test script.  The test script will be
launched on the first instance, and may ssh to the other instances in the
test.  The IP addresses of the first node is provided in $IPADDR, and
subsequent slave nodes in $IPADDR2, etc.  Each test instance will be a
freshly booted zuma-dapper-i386 image.

Scripts should return 0 on success, and any non-zero value on failure.
Tests should only take a few minutes to boot and run, and will be killed at
4 hours if something causes them to stall.

1/ - single instance tests (eg. snapshot-test.sh)
2/ - dual-instance tests (eg. replication-test.sh)
